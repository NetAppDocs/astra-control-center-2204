= Install Astra Control Center using the standard process
:hardbreaks:
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/get-started/

To install Astra Control Center, download the installation bundle from the NetApp Support Site and perform the following steps to install Astra Control Center Operator and Astra Control Center in your environment. You can use this procedure to install Astra Control Center in internet-connected or air-gapped environments.

For Red Hat OpenShift environments, you can also use an link:../get-started/acc_operatorhub_install.html[alternative procedure] to install Astra Control Center using OpenShift OperatorHub.

.What you'll need
* link:requirements.html[Before you begin installation, prepare your environment for Astra Control Center deployment].
* Ensure all cluster operators are in a healthy state and available.
+
OpenShift example:
+
----
oc get clusteroperators
----

* Ensure all API services are in a healthy state and available:
+
OpenShift example:
+
----
oc get apiservices
----

* The Astra FQDN you plan to use needs to be routable to this cluster. This means that you either have a DNS entry in your internal DNS server or you are using a core URL route that is already registered.

.About this task
The Astra Control Center installation process does the following:

* Installs the Astra components into the `netapp-acc` (or custom-named) namespace.
* Creates a default account.
* Establishes a default administrative user email address and default one-time password of `ACC-<UUID_of_installation>` for this instance of Astra Control Center. This user is assigned the Owner role in the system and is needed for first time login to the UI.
* Helps you determine that all Astra Control Center pods are running.
* Installs the Astra UI.
//VMware ADS EAP review

IMPORTANT: (Applies to the Astra Data Store Early Access Program (EAP) release only) If you intend to manage Astra Data Store using Astra Control Center and enable VMware workflows, deploy Astra Control Center only on the `pcloud` namespace and not on the `netapp-acc` namespace or a custom namespace described in the steps of this procedure.

IMPORTANT: Do not execute the following command during the entirety of the installation process to avoid deleting all Astra Control Center pods: `kubectl delete -f astra_control_center_operator_deploy.yaml`

NOTE: If you are using Red Hatâ€™s Podman instead of Docker Engine, Podman commands can be used in place of Docker commands.

.Steps

To install Astra Control Center, do the following steps:

* <<Download and unpack the Astra Control Center bundle>>
//* <<Unpack the bundle and change directory>>
//* <<Unpack the bundle>>
* <<Install the NetApp Astra kubectl plugin>>
* <<Add the images to your local registry>>
* <<Set up namespace and secret for registries with auth requirements>>
* <<Install the Astra Control Center operator>>
* <<Configure Astra Control Center>>

== Download and unpack the Astra Control Center bundle

. Download the Astra Control Center bundle (`astra-control-center-[version].tar.gz`) from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^].
. Download the zip of Astra Control Center certificates and keys from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/astra-control-center/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^].
. (Optional) Use the following command to verify the signature of the bundle:
+
----
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify astra-control-center[version].pub -signature <astra-control-center[version].sig astra-control-center[version].tar.gz
----
. Extract the images:
+
----
tar -vxzf astra-control-center-[version].tar.gz
----

//== Unpack the bundle and change directory
//== Unpack the bundle

== Install the NetApp Astra kubectl plugin

The NetApp Astra `kubectl` command line plugin saves time when performing common tasks associated with deploying and upgrading Astra Control Center.

.What you'll need

NetApp provides binaries for the plugin for different CPU architectures and operating systems. You need to know which CPU and operating system you have before you perform this task. On Linux and Mac operating systems, you can use the `uname -a` command to gather this information.

.Steps

. List the available NetApp Astra `kubectl` plugin binaries, and note the name of the file you need for your operating system and CPU architecture:
+
----
ls kubectl-astra/
----
. Copy the file to the same location as the standard `kubectl` utility. In this example, the `kubectl` utility is located in the `/usr/local/bin` directory. Replace `<binary-name>` with the name of the file you need:
+
----
cp kubectl-astra/<binary-name> /usr/local/bin/kubectl-astra
----

== Add the images to your local registry

. Change to the Astra directory:
+
----
cd acc
----
. Add the files in the Astra Control Center image directory to your local registry.
+
NOTE: See sample scripts for the automatic loading of images below.

.. Log in to your registry:
+
Docker:
+
----
docker login [your_registry_path]
----
+
Podman:
+
----
podman login [your_registry_path]
----

.. Use the appropriate script to load the images, tag the images, and [[substep_image_local_registry_push]]push the images to your local registry:
+
Docker:
+
----
export REGISTRY=[Docker_registry_path]
for astraImageFile in $(ls images/*.tar) ; do
  # Load to local cache. And store the name of the loaded image trimming the 'Loaded images: '
  astraImage=$(docker load --input ${astraImageFile} | sed 's/Loaded image: //')
  astraImage=$(echo ${astraImage} | sed 's!localhost/!!')
  # Tag with local image repo.
  docker tag ${astraImage} ${REGISTRY}/${astraImage}
  # Push to the local repo.
  docker push ${REGISTRY}/${astraImage}
done
----
+
Podman:
+
----
export REGISTRY=[Registry_path]
for astraImageFile in $(ls images/*.tar) ; do
  # Load to local cache. And store the name of the loaded image trimming the 'Loaded images: '
  astraImage=$(podman load --input ${astraImageFile} | sed 's/Loaded image(s): //')
  astraImage=$(echo ${astraImage} | sed 's!localhost/!!')
  # Tag with local image repo.
  podman tag ${astraImage} ${REGISTRY}/${astraImage}
  # Push to the local repo.
  podman push ${REGISTRY}/${astraImage}
done
----

== Set up namespace and secret for registries with auth requirements

.  If you use a registry that requires authentication, you need to do the following:
.. Create the `netapp-acc-operator` namespace:
+
----
kubectl create ns netapp-acc-operator
----
+
Response:
+
----
namespace/netapp-acc-operator created
----

.. Create a secret for the `netapp-acc-operator` namespace. Add Docker information and run the following command:
+
----
kubectl create secret docker-registry astra-registry-cred -n netapp-acc-operator --docker-server=[your_registry_path] --docker-username=[username] --docker-password=[token]
----
+
Sample response:
+
----
secret/astra-registry-cred created
----

.. Create the `netapp-acc` (or custom named) namespace.
+
----
kubectl create ns [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----
+
Sample response:
+
----
namespace/netapp-acc created
----

.. Create a secret for the `netapp-acc` (or custom named) namespace. Add Docker information and run the following command:
+
----
kubectl create secret docker-registry astra-registry-cred -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace] --docker-server=[your_registry_path] --docker-username=[username] --docker-password=[token]
----
+
Response
+
----
secret/astra-registry-cred created
----

.. [[substep_kubeconfig_secret]](Optional) If you want the cluster to be automatically managed by Astra Control Center after installation, make sure that you provide the kubeconfig as a secret within the Astra Control Center namespace you intend to deploy into using this command:
+
----
kubectl create secret generic [acc-kubeconfig-cred or custom secret name] --from-file=<path-to-your-kubeconfig> -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----

== Install the Astra Control Center operator

. Edit the Astra Control Center operator deployment YAML (`astra_control_center_operator_deploy.yaml`) to refer to your local registry and secret.
+
----
vim astra_control_center_operator_deploy.yaml
----

.. If you use a registry that requires authentication, replace the default line of `imagePullSecrets: []` with the following:
+
----
imagePullSecrets:
- name: <name_of_secret_with_creds_to_local_registry>
----

.. Change `[your_registry_path]` for the `kube-rbac-proxy` image to the registry path where you pushed the images in a <<substep_image_local_registry_push,previous step>>.
.. Change `[your_registry_path]` for the `acc-operator-controller-manager` image to the registry path where you pushed the images in a <<substep_image_local_registry_push,previous step>>.
.. (For installations using Astra Data Store preview) See this known issue regarding link:../release-notes/known-issues-ads.html#astra-data-store-cannot-be-used-as-a-storage-class-for-astra-control-center-due-to-mongodb-pod-liveness-probe-failure[storage class provisioners and additional changes you will need to make to the YAML].

== Configure Astra Control Center

. Edit the Astra Control Center custom resource (CR) file (`astra_control_center_min.yaml`) to make account, autoSupport, registry, and other necessary configurations:
+
NOTE: If additional customizations are required for your environment, you can use `astra_control_center.yaml` as an alternative CR. `astra_control_center_min.yaml` is the default CR and is suitable for most installations.

+
----
vim astra_control_center_min.yaml
----
+
NOTE: Properties configured by the CR cannot be changed after initial Astra Control Center deployment.
+
IMPORTANT: If you are using a registry that does not require authorization, you must delete the  `secret` line within `imageRegistry` or the installation will fail.

.. Change `[your_registry_path]` to the registry path where you pushed the images in the previous step.
.. Change the `accountName` string to the name you want to associate with the account.
.. Change the `astraAddress` string to the FQDN you want to use in your browser to access Astra. Do not use `http://` or `https://` in the address. Copy this FQDN for use in a <<Log in to the Astra Control Center UI,later step>>.
.. Change the `email` string to the default initial administrator address. Copy this email address for use in a <<Log in to the Astra Control Center UI,later step>>.
.. Change `enrolled` for AutoSupport to `false` for sites without internet connectivity or retain `true` for connected sites.
.. (Optional) Add a first name `firstName` and last name `lastName` of the user associated with the account. You can perform this step now or later within the UI.
.. (Optional) Change the `storageClass` value to another Trident storageClass resource if required by your installation.
.. (Optional) If you want the cluster to be automatically managed by Astra Control Center after installation and you have already <<substep_kubeconfig_secret,created the secret containing the kubeconfig for this cluster>>, provide the name of the secret by adding a new field to this YAML file called `astraKubeConfigSecret: "acc-kubeconfig-cred or custom secret name"`

.. Complete one of the following steps:
+
* *Other ingress controller (ingressType:Generic)*: This is the default action with Astra Control Center. After Astra Control Center is deployed, you will need to configure the ingress controller to expose Astra Control Center with a URL.
+
The default Astra Control Center installation sets up its gateway (`service/traefik`) to be of the type `ClusterIP`. This default installation requires you to additionally set up a Kubernetes IngressController/Ingress to route traffic to it. If you want to use an ingress, see link:../get-started/install_acc.html#set-up-ingress-for-load-balancing[Set up ingress for load balancing].

* *Service load balancer (ingressType:AccTraefik)*: If you don't want to install an IngressController or create an Ingress resource, set `ingressType` to `AccTraefik`.
+
This deploys the Astra Control Center `traefik` gateway as a Kubernetes LoadBalancer type service.
+
Astra Control Center uses a service of the type "LoadBalancer" (`svc/traefik` in the Astra Control Center namespace), and requires that it be assigned an accessible external IP address. If load balancers are permitted in your environment and you donâ€™t already have one configured, you can use MetalLB or another external service load balancer to assign an external IP address to the service. In the internal DNS server configuration, you should point the chosen DNS name for Astra Control Center to the load-balanced IP address.
+
NOTE: For details about the service type of "LoadBalancer" and ingress, see link:../get-started/requirements.html[Requirements].

== Complete Astra Control Center and operator installation

. If you didn't already do so in a previous step, create the `netapp-acc` (or custom) namespace:
+
----
kubectl create ns [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----
+
Sample response:
+
----
namespace/netapp-acc created
----

. Install Astra Control Center in the `netapp-acc` (or your custom) namespace:
+
----
kubectl apply -f astra_control_center_min.yaml -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----
+
Sample response:
+
----
astracontrolcenter.astra.netapp.io/astra created
----

== Verify system status

NOTE: If you prefer to use OpenShift, you can use comparable oc commands for verification steps.

. Verify that all system components installed successfully.
+
----
kubectl get pods -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----
+
Each pod should have a status of `Running`. It may take several minutes before the system pods are deployed.

. (Optional) To ensure the installation is completed, you can watch the `acc-operator` logs using the following command.
+
----
kubectl logs deploy/acc-operator-controller-manager -n netapp-acc-operator -c manager -f
----
+
NOTE: `accHost` cluster registration is one of the last operations, and if it fails it will not cause deployment to fail. In the event of a cluster registration failure indicated in the logs, you can attempt registration again through the add cluster workflow link:../get-started/setup_overview.html#add-cluster[in the UI] or API.

. When all the pods are running, verify installation success by retrieving the `AstraControlCenter` instance installed by the Astra Control Center Operator.
+
----
kubectl get acc -o yaml -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
----

. In the YAML, check the `status.deploymentState` field in the response for the `Deployed` value. If deployment was unsuccessful, an error message appears instead.
. To get the one-time password you will use when you log in to Astra Control Center, copy the `status.uuid` value. The password is `ACC-` followed by the UUID value (`ACC-[UUID]` or, in this example, `ACC-9aa5fdae-4214-4cb7-9976-5d8b4c0ce27f`).

== Set up ingress for load balancing

You can set up a Kubernetes ingress controller that manages external access to services, such as load balancing in a cluster.

This procedure explains how to set up an ingress controller (`ingressType:Generic`). This is the default action with Astra Control Center. After Astra Control Center is deployed, you will need to configure the ingress controller to expose Astra Control Center with a URL.

NOTE: If you don't want to set up an ingress controller, you can set `ingressType:AccTraefik)`. Astra Control Center uses a service of the type "LoadBalancer" (`svc/traefik` in the Astra Control Center namespace), and requires that it be assigned an accessible external IP address. If load balancers are permitted in your environment and you donâ€™t already have one configured, you can use MetalLB or another external service load balancer to assign an external IP address to the service. In the internal DNS server configuration, you should point the chosen DNS name for Astra Control Center to the load-balanced IP address. For details about the service type of "LoadBalancer" and ingress, see link:../get-started/requirements.html[Requirements].

The steps differ depending on the type of ingress controller you use:

* Nginx ingress controller
* OpenShift ingress controller

.What you'll need

* The required https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/[ingress controller] should already be deployed.
* The https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-class[ingress class] corresponding to the ingress controller should already be created.
* You are using Kubernetes versions between and including v1.19 and v1.22.

.Steps for Nginx ingress controller

. Create a secret of type http://kubernetes.io/tls[`kubernetes.io/tls`] for a TLS private key and certificate in `netapp-acc` (or custom-named) namespace as described in https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets[TLS secrets].
. Deploy an ingress resource in `netapp-acc` (or custom-named) namespace using either the `v1beta1` (deprecated in Kubernetes version less than or 1.22) or `v1` resource type for either a deprecated or a new schema:
.. For a `v1beta1` deprecated schema, follow this sample:
+
----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-acc
  namespace: [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: [class name for nginx controller]
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <ACC address>
    secretName: [tls secret name]
  rules:
  - host: [ACC address]
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
        serviceName: traefik
        servicePort: 80
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
----

.. For the `v1` new schema, follow this sample:
+
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: netapp-acc-ingress
  namespace: [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
spec:
  ingressClassName: [class name for nginx controller]
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <ACC address>
    secretName: [tls secret name]
  rules:
  - host: <ACC addess>
    http:
      paths:
        - path:
          backend:
            service:
              name: traefik
              port:
                number: 80
          pathType: ImplementationSpecific
----

.Steps for OpenShift ingress controller

. Procure your certificate and get the key, certificate, and CA files ready for use by the OpenShift route.
. Create the OpenShift route:
+
----
oc create route edge --service=traefik
--port=web -n [netapp-acc or custom namespace]
--insecure-policy=Redirect --hostname=<ACC address>
--cert=cert.pem --key=key.pem
----


== Log in to the Astra Control Center UI

After installing Astra Control Center, you will change the password for the default administrator and log in to the Astra Control Center UI dashboard.

.Steps
. In a browser, enter the FQDN you used in the `astraAddress` in the  `astra_control_center_min.yaml` CR when <<Install Astra Control Center,you installed Astra Control Center>>.
. Accept the self-signed certificates when prompted.
+
NOTE: You can create a custom certificate after login.

. At the Astra Control Center login page, enter the value you used for `email` in `astra_control_center_min.yaml` CR when <<Install Astra Control Center,you installed Astra Control Center>>, followed by the one-time password (`ACC-[UUID]`).
+
NOTE: If you enter an incorrect password three times, the admin account will be locked for 15 minutes.

. Select *Login*.
. Change the password when prompted.
+
NOTE: If this is your first login and you forget the password and no other administrative user accounts have yet been created, contact NetApp Support for password recovery assistance.

. (Optional) Remove the existing self-signed TLS certificate and replace it with a link:../get-started/add-custom-tls-certificate.html[custom TLS certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA)].

== Troubleshoot the installation

If any of the services are in `Error` status, you can inspect the logs. Look for API response codes in the 400 to 500 range. Those indicate the place where a failure happened.

.Steps

. To inspect the Astra Control Center operator logs, enter the following:
+
----
kubectl logs --follow -n netapp-acc-operator $(kubectl get pods -n netapp-acc-operator -o name)  -c manager
----

== What's next

Complete the deployment by performing link:setup_overview.html[setup tasks].
